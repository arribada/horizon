This directory can be used for storing device keys and certificates.

The VeriSign-Class-3-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem certificate is pre-installed and should be used as the root CA for authentication of the Amazon AWS service by the cellular module.

All other certificates and keys shall be dynamically created by the end user into this directory by using the aws_config tool.  These files shall be named according to the thingName ie thingName.pem, thingName.key.

In order to provision the cellular module, the following command should be used for each thing that is created:

cellular_config --root_ca VeriSign-Class-3-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem --cert thingName.pem --key thingName.key
