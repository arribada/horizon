## About ##
This repository contains CNC millable and 3D printable files to prepare a 500ml plastic bottle enclosure suitable for tracking everyday 500ml plastic drinks bottles.

Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printable enclosure STEP files can be [downloaded from the enclosure repository](https://github.com/arribada/horizon/tree/master/enclosures/bottle). The SLS enclosure fits an Horizon ARTIC R2 board and satellite transmitter in the top cavity, connected to a lithium polymer / lithium-ion battery seated in the bottom cavity. The two halves are connected together with an o-ring preventing water ingress, with two foam cavities providing additional buoyancy. 3D printed inserts enable the components to be encapsulated with epoxy / potting solution to protect them from water ingress and saltwater when deployed in the open ocean.

An alternative method to using SLS is to print using reclaimed or recycled nylon on a suitable 3D printer, with reclaimed nylon sourced from discarded or abandoned fishing nets suitable. Waterproofing is achieve through the use of potting solutions to protect internal electronics and batteries. We recommend exploring the use of reclaimed nylon as a sustainable alternative to SLS printing.

## Assembled enclosure views  ##
**[Figure 1 - below]** The horizon board should be positioned with the GNSS ceramic antenna facing upwards. The ARTIC R2 transmitter is connected via 8mm brass spacers below. If using the 3D printed insert, the two boards can be placed inside and secured with hot glue ready for potting. The insert will position the boards correctly for optimal positioning.

The antenna is connected via an SMA to u.fl connector, with the bulkhead of the SMA connector screwed into the antenna opening. The base of the SMA should also be potted to prevent corrosion.

**[Figure 2 - below]** The two SLS bottle enclosure parts (top and bottom) are secured together using M3 x 10 bolts and nylong locking nuts. There is an optional window that can be milled out and potted with a clear epoxy (i.e MG Chemical Waterclear) to aid viewing the LED status of the Horizon board inside once closed.

**[Figure 3 - below]** An alternative view looking up at the top cavity with the Horizon board (blue) and the ARTIC R2 transmitter (green) visible. Note the positioning of the magnetic reed switch. There is an X embossed onto the wall of the enclosure identifying its position once the bottle enclosure has been sealed.

**[Figure 4 - below]** A transparent view of the top cavity. Note the JST power connector on the left hand side. Before installing the Horizon board, connect a JST cable prior to potting the cavity (it's easy to sometimes forget).

**[Figure 5 - below]** A transparent view of both cavities with a 2-cell lithium-ion battery (grey) positioned in the bottom cavity. Additional foam inserts can be placed in the left and right cavities to provide buoyancy aid and to protect against any future water ingress filling the cavities with water.

## Assembly Guide ##

This guide assumes you have pre-configured your Horizon board and have programmed a configuration to support your deployment. If you have ordered pre-printed parts from Arribada and have the bottle assembly kit to hand you will be able to complete a full assembly after purchasing potting compound (not included in the assembly kit). Consult the BOM list for a full list of provide / supplementary parts. If you intend to print your own parts, [review the CAD repository](https://github.com/arribada/horizon/tree/master/enclosures/bottle) too.

**Stage 1** | Select the top enclosure piece. Next, add two to three pea size amounts of synthetic silicone grease or o-ring lubricant to the o-ring and apply it evenly until covered. Position the o-ring in the o-ring cavity of the enclosure piece.

**Stage 2** |
